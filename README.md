## Introduction
Hi, I'm Fayaz, a software developer with a passion for crafting pixel-perfect applications. I've recently developed a responsive Telegram app clone that seamlessly adapts to both mobile and desktop views. This clone not only mimics the elegant UI of Telegram but also introduces beautiful animations to enhance user interaction. Moreover, it supports both dark mode and light mode, providing a visually appealing experience in any lighting condition. Dive in to explore a modern, responsive, and feature-rich UI that stays true to the essence of Telegram while adding a touch of creativity and functionality.
